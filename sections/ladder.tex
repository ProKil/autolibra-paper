\section{The ladder \protect\includegraphics[height=1em]{figs/ladder.png}: Agent improvement with AutoLibra}


Methods
Improvements
Prompt
Failed attempts
Scores
Defeat null hypothesis of:
- Goal score alone being sufficient
- Human-derived metrics alone being sufficient

(~2 pages total incl. tables, shortened prompts)

Turn 0:

Metrics obtained are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Win Condition Recognition (WCR)
    \item Rule Modification for Obstacle Management (RMO)
    \item Direct Navigation Efficiency (DNE)
    \item Context-Sensitive Decision Making (CSDM)
\end{itemize}
Win condition recognition prequisite to all other metrics, turn 1 improvements target this metric specifically.

Turn 0 trajectory appears stochastic, âˆ´ impossible for human to isolate model behaviors for targeted improvement; very low goal score/random trajectory makes using goal score as an agent improvement metric not useful in this case.

Turn 1 improvement and motivation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Few-shot prompting, targets WCR by giving model example of identifying win condition from native env observations
    \item Subtask-level planning guidance, target improvement of CSDM and WCR by mapping environment observations to goals, which model could not do in turn 0
\end{enumerate}

Turn 1:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Improvement in WCR vs Turn 0, indicating T1 improvements worked
    \item Slight improvement in RMO, DNE, CSDM but not statistically significant
    \item Overall improvement in BALROG score because agent seeks objectives
    \item Qualitatively, agent now targets specific blocks instead of randomly walking - but also now gets stuck when objective complex or multi-step
\end{itemize}

Metrics obtained are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Win Rule Construction (WR)
    \item Selective Interaction with Relevant Objects (SI)
    \item Rule Manipulation and Execution (RME)
\end{itemize}

Turn 2 unsuccessful improvements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1-step location and action history as part of observation
    \item 5-step location and action history as part of observation
    \item Movement templates (
\end{enumerate}

Turn 2 improvement and motivation:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Augment subtask-level planning with positional instructions
    \item Meta prompting 
\end{enumerate}
