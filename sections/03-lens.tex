\section{The lens \protect\includegraphics[height=1em]{figs/microscope.png}: Agent evaluation with AutoLibra}
\label{sec:lens}



In this section, we use AutoLibra as a lens to provide insights into agent behaviors. We first ask whether 
the induced metrics can reflect human feedback even if they are not seen during the induction process.
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:coverage-redundancy},
we show the best coverage and redundancy of metrics of different numbers $N$. 
Intuitively, the more metrics we induce, the higher the coverage and redundancy. However we do find that
at around $N=6$ to $N=10$, the coverage is at its peak, and adding more metrics will not improve the coverage
but will increase the redundancy. 



\subsection{How do AutoLibra metrics compare with human-derived metrics?}



\subsection{Are examples in the metrics useful for LLM-as-a-Judge?}
